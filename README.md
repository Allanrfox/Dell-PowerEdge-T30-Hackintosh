Another one of my Opencore archives

As stated in the X1 Carbon repo this is an effort of mine to actively backup my EFIs, you're free to use them though I can't garantuee all features will work (Even if we have the exact same hardware)

Yes I own a Skylake Dell Server that retails for 999USD (last time i checked), obviously I have no love life, but that doesnt impeed me from having a flexible and an overall great experience on this machine 

My Model is equipped with a Xeon E5-1225 v5, 16gb ECC ram, 3 HDDs, no dGPU

Tested Big Sur 11.0.1 up to 11.5.2 (I have tried monterey but when getting to the apple logo part my display looses signal so lol

I have no wifi card so no continuity features and since no dGPU means no DRM

if you can help me fix the monterey issue it would be greatly appreciated
