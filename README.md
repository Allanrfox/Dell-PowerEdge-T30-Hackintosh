# Dell-PowerEdge-T30-Hackintosh
Another one of my Opencore archives

As stated in the X1 Carbon repo this is an effort of mine to actively backup my EFIs, you're free to use them though I can't garantuee all features will work (Even if we have the exact same hardware)

Yes I own a Skylake Dell Server that retails for 999USD (last time i checked), obviously I have no love life, but that doesnt impeed me from having a flexible and an overall great experience on this machine 

My Model is equipped with a Xeon E5-1225 v5, 16gb ECC ram, 3 HDDs, no dGPU

Tested Big Sur 11.0.1 up to 11.5.2 (I have tried monterey but when getting to the apple logo part my display looses signal so lol

I have no wifi card so no continuity features and since no dGPU means no DRM

if you can help me fix the monterey issue it would be greatly appreciated
